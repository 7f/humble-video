WARNING: You must define the environment variable HUMBLE_HOME
to point to a directory where the includes and libraries
generated by this program get installed to. This ensures
that the specially built versions do not get installed into
/usr/local (the default area).

This directory contains a series of software packages
that FFmpeg will use, along with FFmpeg itself.

The system works by building all the other projects,
and installing them in a fake location, and then building
FFmpeg.  In that way, you can be sure that FFmpeg sees
the exact versions of libraries included in this package.

Finally, a "make install" will install FFmpeg and all dependent
libraries into the location you specify.
