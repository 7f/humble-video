This project contains a system that builds all the external
native libraries that Humble Software depends on.

WARNING: You must define the environment variable HUMBLE_HOME
to point to a directory where the includes and libraries
generated by this program get installed to. This ensures
that the specially built versions do not get installed into
/usr/local (the default area).

The right way to run configure is something like:

    HUMBLE_HOME=/path/to/install/everything configure

Or to cross compile:

    HOME_HOME=/path/to/install/everything/i686-apple-darwin12.4.0 configure --build=i686-apple-darwin12.4.0
    make && make install
