This package contains all the Java-only (i.e. no native artfacts) code for Humble Video.

Much of this package is auto-generated from the humble-video-native project, but not all. In particular Memory Management and library loading code is here.

There are also a small set of tests including in this package that are meant to smoke-test Humble Video, but long running tests should go into ```humble-video-tests```.
