This is the humble-video project. 

Welcome to the Humble Video uber project. It consists of several sub-projects which are detailed below:

* `humble-video-captive/`: All open-source libraries incorporated into humble-video. These are built with a custom build system.
* `humble-video-native/`: All native (C/C++/Assembly) code for Humble-Video. These are built with a custom build system that generates
     many Maven artifacts containing native code. and generate Java files. The maven artifacts generated are of the form:
     `humble-video-arch-${architecture-specifier}.jar` and the architecture-specifier looks like `i686-gnu-linux` for 32-bit linux, etc.
     For users who do not want to always download artifacts that contain all architectures, these are valid POMs to be depended on.
  that are inserted into `humble-video-main`.
* `humble-video-arch-all/`: A maven POM project that has dependencies on all the native-code POMs generated by `humble-video-native`.
* `humble-video-noarch/`: All Java code (and only Java code), including some generated Java code from `humble-video-native`.
     These are built with maven. 
* `humble-video/`: A jar that depends on humble-video-noarch and humble-video-arch-all.
* `humble-video-tests-unit/`: All unit test for humble-video-noarch. This depends on humble-video-arch-all so native code must be built for tests to run.
* `humble-video-tests-integration/`: All integration (very long running) tests for humble-video. Depends on humble-video.


This project builds native code that can be used for Humble Software, and
also generates Java files that can be compiled into Maven libraries
that use the native code.

To build the native code the autotools stack is required:

* GNU c++ compilers
* YASM (for assembly)
* The Xuggle-Swig version of Swig (Use https://github.com/artclarke/xuggle-swig to get JavaDoc generated). If you can't do that, you must use Swig 1.3.
* Doxygen & DOT (for C++ documentation)
* Valgrind (for auto memory leak detection -- try 'make memcheck')
* Java JDK 1.6 or higher

The 'brew' utility is your on Mac OS X friend. Use it often.

Oddly enough, you'll also need (soon) Oracle's VirtualBox installed as well.

Enjoy!
