This package containers a variety of demonstration programs using the Humble API.

I recommend going through each one in the following order, as they gradually introduce new
concepts.

| Demo | Location | What You'll Learn |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------- |
| GetContainerInfo | io.humble.video.demos.GetContainerInfo | How to open up a media file (Container) and query the contents of that container. |
| DecodeAndPlayAudio | io.humble.video.demos.DecodeAndPlayAudio | How to open a media file, find an audio stream, decode/uncompress the audio, and play it back on your speakers. |

If you are brand-new to video programming, I recommend you review this short series of videos first: http://blog.xuggle.com/2009/01/23/overly-simplistic-guide-to-internet-video/
